Andrew Su - data visualization (USA_Population_Distribution.html) with embedded JavaScript on population per state in the USA. The user interacts with this by mouse-hovering over the bars to display the results, which have numbers per age range in each state. If the mouse moves to a new bar, the data for that bar will display its own results. If the user mouse-hovers off any bar, no data is shown.
