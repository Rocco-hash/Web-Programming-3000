David Vinci:Visualization 2: In my folder there is a files folder, in that contains "d22a6e9c4b47d398faffbefad669e5b807a0c8bc3eaf4d28edfd52330fa48ac1" which is the name of the files SHA256 hash for my csv data. The  file named "75faaaca1f1a4f415145b9db520349a3a0b93a53c1071346a30e6824586a7c251f45367d9262ed148b7a2b5c2694aa7703f3ac88051abc65066fd0074fdf9c9e" contains all of the data with that creates the map of the USA. The file named "438813e85a5cfb28@205.js" is the javascript file containing the data, color, scale, and map. The file named "a33468b95d0b15b0@703" also handles color but seems like it is the intensity of the color. It also handles the scale and legend. The file names "index.html" imports different files."index.js" exports from "438813e85a5cfb28@205.js", im not really sure what that accomplishes. "inspector.css" formats the main page."package.json" looks like it just shows what allof the files in the original file does. Im not 100% sure what "runtime.js" does but i think that may be the reason why i cant just simply change the file names to msomething more readable. I think it might be checking is see if the file type is waht they want etc.

Andrew Su - data visualization (USA_Population_Distribution.html) with embedded JavaScript on population per state in the USA. The user interacts with this by mouse-hovering over the bars to display the results, which have numbers per age range in each state. If the mouse moves to a new bar, the data for that bar will display its own results. If the user mouse-hovers off any bar, no data is shown.
